In this part we created our first react app using command "npx create-react-app firstapp"

our first react will be created and then open the source code in any editor

Here I used VS code as it is easy to use. open the project directory and write "code ." to open source code directly in VS code.

In the command prompt in your project directory enter" npm start" to run your application on default browser. it will show you working and changes made in application.

After source code is opened in VS code now we can make changes desired in App.js file and press "CTRL+S" to save it.

Changes will be reflected in app opened in the browser.

------------- THATS ALL ! --------------
